[简体中文](README.md) | English

Agent skills for **selecting, positioning, writing, identifying, formatting, internally refereeing, submitting, and revising** manuscripts targeted at the *American Economic Review* (AER), *AER: Insights*, and the *AEJ* family.

This repository is opinionated. It is **not** a generic economics writing toolbox. It is a **top-5 economics skill stack** for: identification-first empirics, AEA-policy-compliant replication packages, Keith-Head-style introductions, AER-style booktabs tables, and editor-efficient rebuttals.

## Recent Upgrades

v1.5 makes every installed skill **self-contained**: fourteen skills now bundle
a distilled `references/*.md` depth file inside the skill directory --- estimator
playbook, robustness menu, intro/abstract templates, section skeletons, venue
router, referee scoring rubric, consistency audit checklist, rebuttal response
patterns, AEA replication checklist, submission final audit, PAP template,
citation-verification protocol, workflow gate map, and exhibit cookbook --- so
the plugin or script install carries its core guidance without the repository
checkout. A new bundled-reference gate in `scripts/validate_repo.py` enforces
the standard (bundle exists, SKILL.md routes to it, mentioned files exist), and
the bundled prose sits under the existing citation-groundedness and hygiene
gates. See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

v1.4 extends the lifecycle to **ex-ante design** and closes two referee-frontier
method gaps. It adds a 15th skill,
[`aer-preregistration`](skills/aer-preregistration/SKILL.md) (pre-analysis plan,
power/MDE-justified sample size, AEA RCT Registry), **4 new numeric-contract
demos** (Sun-Abraham interaction-weighted event study, Lee-bounds partial
identification, the Cinelli-Hazlett robustness value, and power/MDE with the
Type-M exaggeration ratio — 20 new assertions), a
[referee-calibration harness](scripts/referee_calibration.py) that turns the
simulation's score-to-verdict mapping into an executable gate, and a
[methods coverage matrix](docs/methods-coverage-matrix.md). See the
[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

v1.3 closes the method-coverage gaps listed in the roadmap: **5 new
numeric-contract demos** (randomization inference, QTE, LP-DiD, bunching,
matrix completion — 21 new assertions), 7 Crossref-verified references, a
StatsPAI registry expanded to 51 validated bindings, plus Zenodo archiving
metadata and a launch kit. See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

The theme of v1.2 is **verifiability**: every discipline the skills impose on a manuscript is machine-enforced on the repository itself first (full status in the [quality scorecard](docs/quality-scorecard.md), plan in the [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md), history in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)):

- **Numeric-correctness contract**: 11 runnable demos, 47 `NUMERIC-CHECK` assertions — every estimate pinned to a known truth within a stated tolerance; "runs but wrong" fails.
- **Citation groundedness gate**: every prose citation must resolve to a Crossref-verified bib entry — `PHANTOM_CITATION` / `DANGLING_KEY` are hard failures.
- **Tool-binding contract**: method skills route to 43 validated StatsPAI tools; no hand-rolled estimators.
- **The quality tooling is itself tested**: 246 hermetic unit tests under `tests/` (`make test`).
- **New examples**: the [end-to-end walkthrough](examples/end-to-end-walkthrough.md) (one paper through all 12 steps) and the [DML demo](examples/dml-plr-demo/) (orthogonalization + cross-fitting vs. the naive ML plug-in).
- CI now runs three jobs — structural validation, unit tests, and the full numeric smoke over every Python demo — on every push and PR.

v1.1 grew the stack from ten skills to fourteen (`aer-literature`, `aer-paper-body`, `aer-consistency`, `aer-referee-sim`) and established the 12-step gated workflow.

## Why a Separate AER Skill Stack?

Top-5 economics journals impose constraints that do not exist in life-science venues:

| Constraint                       | AER                | AER: Insights       | Implication                                          |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Abstract length                  | **100 words**      | 100 words           | 4-5 sentences. Sell results, not motivation.         |
| Main text length                 | ~40 typeset pages  | **≤ 7,000 words minus 200 per exhibit** | Tight prose; five exhibits leave 6,000 words.        |
| Desk rejection                   | High               | **~45%**            | First 3 pages decide the verdict.                    |
| Replication                      | Mandatory          | Mandatory           | AEA Data and Code Availability Policy is enforced.   |
| Identification                   | Causal, design-based| Causal, design-based | TWFE, weak IV, and naive RDD get desk-rejected.     |
| Cover letter                     | Optional           | Optional            | Use only for COI disclosure or data access limits.   |
| Disclosure statements            | Required           | Required            | One separate PDF per coauthor, even with no conflicts. |

Generic "scientific writing" skills (e.g. [Nature-Paper-Skills](https://github.com/Boom5426/Nature-Paper-Skills), [nature-skills](https://github.com/Yuan1z0825/nature-skills)) miss these constraints.

### An honest comparison with adjacent projects

| Project | What it is | How AER-Skills differs |
|---|---|---|
| Nature/generic writing skill packs | Life-science writing skills | No top-5 economics constraints; no machine-enforced quality gates |
| Dynamic econometrics agents (e.g. Econometrics-Agent) | Runtime: pick tools, run code | They cover the *estimation* station only — not topic selection, literature, writing, refereeing, or submission. AER-Skills composes with such engines via `aer-statspai` |
| Deep-research agents (e.g. open_deep_research) | General research synthesis | Their groundedness-evaluation idea is implemented here as a hard gate, but they do not produce a submittable economics manuscript |
| **AER-Skills** | **Full-lifecycle skill stack, topic to R&R** | **Every design principle has a matching machine gate — citations verified, numbers pinned, tools validated, document quality floored — all enforced by CI** (see the [quality scorecard](docs/quality-scorecard.md)) |

## Quick Start

### Option A — Claude Code Plugin (recommended)

```bash
# Add the marketplace (one-time)
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/AER-Skills

# Install the plugin
/plugin install aer-skills

# Reload
/reload-plugins
```

All fifteen skills are then available automatically.

### Option B — Scripted Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/AER-Skills.git
cd AER-Skills

# Claude Code (user-scoped)
python3 scripts/install_skills.py claude

# Or Codex
python3 scripts/install_skills.py codex
```

The installer copies the full skill directories, including each skill's
bundled `references/` depth files, so the core guidance is self-contained
after installation. Use `--replace` when updating an existing install, and
`--dry-run` to inspect planned copies first. Keep the cloned repository
available if you also want the `templates/` and `examples/` resources
referenced by the skills.

### First Prompt

After restarting your agent:

```text
Use aer-workflow to tell me which skill I should use next for this manuscript.
```

For longer install instructions see [docs/installation-claude.md](docs/installation-claude.md) and [docs/installation-codex.md](docs/installation-codex.md).

---

## Default Workflow

```text
aer-topic-selection
    -> aer-literature
        -> aer-identification
            -> aer-robustness
                -> aer-paper-body
                    -> aer-introduction
                        -> aer-tables-figures
                            -> aer-consistency
                                -> aer-referee-sim   (loop until ≥ major R&R)
                                    -> aer-replication
                                        -> aer-submission
                                            -> aer-rebuttal
```

The default assumption is:

- **identification before writing** — if your design is fragile, no prose will save it
- **AER vs AER:Insights vs AEJ** is a *routing* decision made before the abstract is written
- **the body is written before the introduction** — the intro summarizes a paper, it does not promise one
- **no citation is written from memory** — every reference is verified against a fetched source
- **the manuscript must survive its own referees** — a consistency audit and an adversarial referee simulation gate the submission
- **replication package quality** is part of the paper, not an afterthought
- **rebuttal letters** are written against the *revised* manuscript, never against the old draft

See [docs/workflow-map.md](docs/workflow-map.md).

## Skills

### Core — Lifecycle

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`aer-workflow`](skills/aer-workflow/SKILL.md) | Routing map with quality gates. Tells you which skill to use next. |
| [`aer-topic-selection`](skills/aer-topic-selection/SKILL.md) | Top-5 bar test, novelty audit, AER vs Insights vs AEJ routing. |
| [`aer-literature`](skills/aer-literature/SKILL.md) | Closest-papers map, positioning moves, and the citation-integrity protocol — every reference verified, no hallucinated citations. |
| [`aer-identification`](skills/aer-identification/SKILL.md) | DiD (staggered), IV (weak-IV-robust), RDD, SCM, shift-share/Bartik. |
| [`aer-preregistration`](skills/aer-preregistration/SKILL.md) | Ex-ante gate for experiments and primary-data collection: pre-analysis plan, power/MDE-justified sample size, AEA RCT Registry, pre-specified vs. exploratory. |
| [`aer-robustness`](skills/aer-robustness/SKILL.md) | Robustness, heterogeneity, mechanism, placebo. Referee-anticipating. |
| [`aer-paper-body`](skills/aer-paper-body/SKILL.md) | Body sections — background, data, empirical strategy, finding-first results narration, magnitude interpretation, mechanisms, conclusion. |
| [`aer-introduction`](skills/aer-introduction/SKILL.md) | Keith Head five-paragraph formula + 100-word abstract drafting. |
| [`aer-tables-figures`](skills/aer-tables-figures/SKILL.md) | AER booktabs style, `etable`/`estout`/`modelsummary`, figure notes. |
| [`aer-consistency`](skills/aer-consistency/SKILL.md) | Full-manuscript integrity audit — numbers vs tables, sample funnels, log-point conversions, cross-references, citation two-way match. Ships a runnable LaTeX audit script. |
| [`aer-referee-sim`](skills/aer-referee-sim/SKILL.md) | Adversarial internal review — desk screen plus three calibrated referee reports, scored against the editorial rubric; loop until ≥ major R&R. |
| [`aer-replication`](skills/aer-replication/SKILL.md) | AEA Data and Code Availability Policy, README, openICPSR. |
| [`aer-submission`](skills/aer-submission/SKILL.md) | Format preflight, cover letter, length audit, conflict declaration. |
| [`aer-rebuttal`](skills/aer-rebuttal/SKILL.md) | R&R response letter, triage, concede / clarify / push-back rules. |

### Optional — Implementation Engine

A second way to *run* the empirics, alongside the hand-written templates below.

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`aer-statspai`](skills/aer-statspai/SKILL.md) | Run the analysis with [StatsPAI](https://github.com/brycewang-stanford/StatsPAI) — an agent-native unified Python engine + MCP server covering DiD / IV / RDD / SCM / DML, `audit_result` robustness, honest-DiD / Oster sensitivity, and `to_latex` / `to_docx` table export. Executes the design; `aer-identification` still chooses it. |

---

## Code Templates

Drop-in, version-conscious scripts for three common empirical economics stacks. Each
template includes a master script, a Callaway-Sant'Anna DiD example, an
AER-style booktabs regression table, and a README.

| Language | Stack | Path |
|---|---|---|
| Stata | `reghdfe`, `csdid`, `estout`, `bacondecomp`, `honestdid` | [`templates/stata/`](templates/stata/) |
| R | `fixest`, `did`, `HonestDiD`, `modelsummary`, `fwildclusterboot` | [`templates/r/`](templates/r/) |
| Python | `pyfixest`, `differences`, `linearmodels`, `statsmodels`, `rdrobust`, `rddensity` | [`templates/python/`](templates/python/) |

Each template enforces: fixed seed (`20260101`), relative paths, package
version documentation or exact pins where the stack supports them, AER booktabs
table style, and vector-format figures.

Scaffold a project without manually copying files:

```bash
python3 scripts/scaffold_project.py stata /path/to/new-project
python3 scripts/scaffold_project.py r /path/to/new-project
python3 scripts/scaffold_project.py python /path/to/new-project
python3 scripts/scaffold_project.py skeleton /path/to/new-replication-package

# or via Make
make scaffold-stata DEST=/path/to/new-project
```

Use `--dry-run` to inspect planned copies. The scaffolder refuses protected
destinations such as repository-internal paths and bundled template source
trees; create paper projects outside this repository.

## Validation

Run the repository checks before copying skills into an agent profile or opening
a PR:

```bash
make preflight
# equivalent: python3 scripts/validate_repo.py
```

`make preflight` also runs staged and unstaged `git diff --check` for
whitespace and patch hygiene.
The validator checks skill frontmatter, skill directory shape, agent metadata,
plugin manifests, local Markdown links, template layout, exact Python
dependency pins and import coverage, installer and scaffolder behavior,
generated/cache file exclusions, and Python/R/Stata template syntax. R syntax checks are skipped
with a warning when `Rscript` is unavailable. CI installs R, runs
`make preflight`, then runs `make validate-strict`, which fails instead of
skipping optional-tool checks.

Runnable example Monte Carlo assertions are the optional second-layer gate.
After installing the dependencies in `templates/python/requirements.txt` (and
the R packages when needed), run:

```bash
make smoke-examples
# or: python3 scripts/run_example_smoke.py --strict-deps
```

The default mode skips demos whose optional dependencies are missing. Use
`--strict-deps` before release so any missing dependency or failed assertion
returns a non-zero status.

The quality tooling is itself tested: `make test` runs the 272 hermetic unit
tests under `tests/` (no network, no optional stacks) covering the validator,
citation verifier, skill auditor, smoke runner, scaffolder, and installer.
`make scorecard` regenerates the [quality scorecard](docs/quality-scorecard.md);
preflight fails whenever the committed scorecard drifts from the measured state.

`make preflight` also runs the citation-integrity gate
(`verify_citations.py --selftest`): a hermetic, gold-set check that
`references.bib` still matches the Crossref/OpenAlex metadata it was verified
against — turning *"no citation from memory"* from a principle into a
re-runnable test. Verify against the live indexes with
`make verify-citations-online`, and check a draft's `\cite` ↔ bib
correspondence with `--manuscript`. See the
[citation-integrity protocol](docs/citation-integrity-protocol.md).

## Examples

Worked examples grounded in classic AER and adjacent-top-5 papers.
See the full examples index in [examples/README.md](examples/README.md).

| File | What it shows |
|---|---|
| [`examples/end-to-end-walkthrough.md`](examples/end-to-end-walkthrough.md) | **Start here** — the same fictional paper traced through all 12 workflow steps, naming the skill, the gate, and the artifact at each step, stitching the other examples into one route |
| [`examples/aer-exemplars.md`](examples/aer-exemplars.md) | Classic papers (Card-Krueger, AJR, ADH, Dell, Chetty-Hendren, Abadie, BDGK, Karlan-List …) mapped to each skill, with openICPSR / Dataverse links |
| [`examples/modern-aer-exemplars.md`](examples/modern-aer-exemplars.md) | **30+ recent (2018-2025) papers organized by 13 subfields** — Labor, Public, Development, Trade, Macro, IO, Health, Environment, Urban, Education, Finance, Political Economy, Social Networks — plus the modern identification-methods toolkit. Each with deposit link |
| [`examples/intro-example.md`](examples/intro-example.md) | Full Keith Head five-paragraph introduction + 97-word abstract, with a counterexample of what not to write |
| [`examples/results-section-example.md`](examples/results-section-example.md) | Worked body-section narration for the same fictional paper — sample funnel, finding-first results paragraphs, magnitude conversions, back-of-envelope calculation, mechanisms by channel, plus a table-walk-through counterexample |
| [`examples/rebuttal-example.md`](examples/rebuttal-example.md) | Complete R&R response: cover letter + editor + 3 referees, demonstrating concede / clarify / push-back / decline outcomes |
| [`examples/referee-report-example.md`](examples/referee-report-example.md) | Full internal referee simulation — desk screen, three adversarial reports, rubric-scored synthesis, routed revise list — catching before submission the issues that cost the fictional authors an R&R round |
| [`examples/replication-package-skeleton/`](examples/replication-package-skeleton/) | Deposit-ready directory layout with AEA-compliant README template, master script, and globals file — drop-in starting point for an openICPSR submission |
| [`examples/staggered-did-demo/`](examples/staggered-did-demo/) | Runnable Python/R simulation showing why naive TWFE fails under staggered adoption |
| [`examples/iv-weak-instrument-demo/`](examples/iv-weak-instrument-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation contrasting conventional 2SLS inference with Anderson-Rubin inference |
| [`examples/rdd-polynomial-demo/`](examples/rdd-polynomial-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why high-order global-polynomial RDD is unsafe |
| [`examples/synthetic-control-demo/`](examples/synthetic-control-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why synthetic-control inference comes from the placebo-in-space permutation distribution, not visual pre-period fit |
| [`examples/shift-share-demo/`](examples/shift-share-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why shift-share/Bartik inference belongs at the shock (industry) level, not the region level — region-clustered SEs over-reject |
| [`examples/few-clusters-demo/`](examples/few-clusters-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why a cluster-robust t-test over-rejects with few clusters and the wild cluster bootstrap restores nominal size |
| [`examples/multiple-testing-demo/`](examples/multiple-testing-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why testing many outcomes inflates the family-wise error rate and how Bonferroni/Holm control it without killing power |
| [`examples/spec-curve-demo/`](examples/spec-curve-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why a single "preferred" specification can mislead and the specification-curve permutation test is the honest joint inference |
| [`examples/oster-ovb-demo/`](examples/oster-ovb-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why coefficient stability is not evidence against omitted-variable bias unless scaled by R-squared movement (Oster delta) |
| [`examples/honest-did-demo/`](examples/honest-did-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why a flat-looking pre-trend can break naive parallel-trends coverage and honest DiD relative-magnitudes bounds restore it |
| [`examples/dml-plr-demo/`](examples/dml-plr-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why flexible ML prediction alone is not causal inference — a non-orthogonal plug-in stays attenuated at a knowable factor while DML partialling-out with cross-fitting recovers the truth with honest coverage |
| [`examples/randomization-inference-demo/`](examples/randomization-inference-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why robust-SE t-tests over-reject in small experiments with concentrated leverage and the Fisher randomization test has exact size while retaining power |
| [`examples/qte-demo/`](examples/qte-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why a null ATE can hide large distributional effects — quantile treatment effects recover the analytic QTE curve while OLS sees nothing |
| [`examples/lp-did-demo/`](examples/lp-did-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why pooled TWFE event studies are contaminated under staggered adoption with heterogeneous dynamics and LP-DiD with clean controls recovers the true dynamic path |
| [`examples/bunching-demo/`](examples/bunching-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing how excess mass at a tax kink identifies the earnings elasticity (Saez), with oracle-vs-feasible counterfactuals and two falsification worlds |
| [`examples/matrix-completion-demo/`](examples/matrix-completion-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why DiD is structurally biased under interactive fixed effects and low-rank matrix-completion imputation recovers the truth — including the rank-sensitivity caveat |
| [`examples/sun-abraham-demo/`](examples/sun-abraham-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why the naive dynamic TWFE event study is a contaminated cross-cohort mixture under heterogeneous dynamics and the Sun-Abraham interaction-weighted estimator recovers the true dynamic path in one saturated regression |
| [`examples/lee-bounds-demo/`](examples/lee-bounds-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why differential attrition breaks point identification in an RCT and Lee (2009) trimming bounds recover a valid interval around the always-selected effect — the right answer is an interval, not a number |
| [`examples/sensitivity-rv-demo/`](examples/sensitivity-rv-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why coefficient stability does not bound omitted-variable bias and the Cinelli-Hazlett robustness value reports the partial R-squared a confounder needs to overturn the result |
| [`examples/power-mde-demo/`](examples/power-mde-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why the analytic minimum detectable effect is exactly the target-power effect and an underpowered design exaggerates the estimates it manages to detect (Type-M) |

## Design Principles

- **Identification-driven, not narrative-driven.** Decide and stress-test the research design *before* writing prose.
- **One contribution per paper.** AER editors reject competent extensions; rewrite around a single sharpest claim.
- **Cross-subfield interest is a hard filter.** A labor paper must speak to public, macro, and IO economists or it desk-rejects.
- **Modern econometrics, not 1990s defaults.** TWFE → Callaway-Sant'Anna; first-stage F → Anderson-Rubin; naive RDD → covariate-adjusted local linear.
- **No citation from memory.** Every reference is verified against a fetched source; every attributed claim is checked against the paper's text.
- **The manuscript must survive its own referees.** A full consistency audit (`aer-consistency`) and an adversarial referee simulation (`aer-referee-sim`) gate every submission.
- **The replication package is part of the paper.** A README that does not run is grounds for AEA Data Editor delay.
- **Editor time is the scarcest resource.** Cover letter ≤ 200 words. Response letter quotes the comment, states the action, and cites the revised location.

## Scope

This repository is for:

- *American Economic Review* (full-length papers, ≤ 40 pages)
- *American Economic Review: Insights* (short-form, ≤ 7,000 words minus 200 per exhibit; ≤ 6,000 words with five exhibits)
- *American Economic Journal* family (Applied, Policy, Macro, Micro)
- Empirical and theoretical economics manuscripts
- Field experiments (with AEA RCT Registry workflow)

This repository is **not** trying to be:

- A finance-journal toolbox (JF, JFE, RFS have their own conventions)
- A theory-only stack (no proof-writing helpers)
- A generic "academic writing" library
