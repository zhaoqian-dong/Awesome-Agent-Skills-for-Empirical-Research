# AER Literature

## Overview

This skill does two jobs that AER referees grade separately:

1. **Positioning** — finding the closest predecessors, mapping what each did
   and missed, and choosing the value-added claim the paper can actually
   defend. A mispositioned paper draws the fatal report sentence "the authors
   appear unaware of [paper]."
2. **Citation integrity** — guaranteeing that every reference exists, says
   what the manuscript claims it says, and is cited to the right version.

The second job is **non-negotiable for AI-assisted manuscripts**. Language
models produce plausible-looking citations that do not exist, attach real
authors to invented titles, and attribute findings to papers that show the
opposite. One hallucinated reference, found by a referee, destroys the
credibility of every other sentence in the paper. The working rule:

> **No citation is written from memory. Every entry is verified against a
> fetched source before it enters the bibliography, and every claim about a
> paper is verified against that paper's actual text.**

## When to Use

- During `aer-topic-selection`, to run the novelty scan before committing
- Before `aer-introduction`, to build the antecedents paragraph
- When a referee names a missed paper and the positioning needs repair
- Before submission, as the bibliography verification pass (pairs with
  `aer-consistency`)

## Search Protocol

Run all five channels — each finds papers the others miss:

1. **Working-paper series**: NBER, CEPR, IZA, SSRN, BFI. Top-5 competitors
   live here for 2-4 years before publication; the novelty threat is almost
   always an unpublished working paper, not a published article.
2. **RePEc / IDEAS and Google Scholar**, searching by question ("effect of X
   on Y"), by method-in-setting, and by dataset name. Dataset search catches
   the most dangerous neighbor: someone using the same data.
3. **Forward citations** of the two or three obvious antecedents — everyone
   who cited them since, sorted by recency.
4. **Recent tables of contents**: AER, QJE, JPE, Econometrica, ReStud, AEJ
   family, ReStat, JEEA — last 3-5 years, scanning titles in the subfield.
5. **Handbook chapters and *Journal of Economic Perspectives* / *Annual
   Review of Economics* surveys** for the field's own map of itself.

Log every search (channel, query, date, hits) — the log answers the referee
who asks "did you know about X?" and feeds the novelty audit in
`aer-topic-selection`.

## The Antecedents Map

Reduce the search to the **3-6 closest papers** and fill this table honestly
— it is the skeleton of the introduction's antecedents paragraph and the
evidence base for the contribution claim:

| Paper | Question | Data / setting | Identification | Headline finding | What it does not do |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A (2019) | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Rules:

- "What it does not do" must be a fact about the paper, not a slight. The
  introduction will say it in neutral language; referees include these
  authors.
- If the closest paper answers the same question with the same data and a
  defensible design, the contribution claim must change — return to
  `aer-topic-selection` rather than writing around the conflict.
- Verify each row against the paper's **published version** — abstracts and
  early working papers often differ from the final result.

## Positioning Moves

The value-added paragraph claims one primary move (plus at most two
supporting ones):

| Move | Defensible when |
|---|---|
| New question | No antecedent asks it — and it matters that nobody has |
| New identification | Antecedents are correlational or use a now-rejected design |
| New data | Resolution, coverage, or linkage the literature lacked |
| New mechanism | The *why* was open even though the *whether* was settled |
| Opposite / corrected finding | A credibly identified sign flip or magnitude revision |
| Unification | Two literatures explained by one framework or fact |

Match the claim to the map: a "new identification" claim dies instantly if
row 3 of the antecedents table already used the same design.

## Citation Coverage Norms

- A full-length empirical AER paper typically carries **50-110 references**;
  *AER: Insights* far fewer. Padding is as suspicious as thinness.
- Cite: every antecedent in the map; the primary source for every estimator
  and diagnostic (keys in `docs/methods-reference.md`, entries in
  `references.bib`); the source for every institutional fact and every
  benchmark magnitude used in Results.
- Do not cite: textbooks in place of original methods papers; surveys as
  stand-ins for the specific result being invoked; papers included only to
  flatter potential referees.
- Cite the **published version** wherever one exists. Citing the 2019 NBER
  version of a 2021 AER paper signals a stale literature review. Cite a
  working paper only when it is genuinely unpublished — and re-check its
  status at submission time.

## Citation Integrity Protocol

Run this pipeline for **every** reference. No step is skippable for entries
the model "remembers."

### Step 1 — Existence

Verify against an authoritative record: resolve the DOI (Crossref /
doi.org), or match the exact title and author list on the journal page,
RePEc, or the NBER/SSRN abstract page. A reference with no resolvable DOI
and no locatable landing page does not go in the bibliography. Use a web
search or fetch for every entry; if a Zotero or reference-manager connection
is available, import from the verified record rather than typing fields.

### Step 2 — Field accuracy

Check, character by character, against the verified record: full author
list and order, spelling and diacritics, year, exact title, journal, volume,
issue, pages, DOI. The most common AI corruption modes: swapped coauthors,
off-by-one years (working paper vs. publication), a real author pair
attached to an invented title, and the wrong journal in the right family
(AEJ: Applied vs. AEJ: Policy).

### Step 3 — Claim accuracy

For every in-text sentence of the form "[Author (year)] find/show/argue X,"
read at least the abstract — and the relevant table if a magnitude is
quoted. The claim must match what the paper actually establishes, including
sign, population, and design caveats. Misattribution to a *real* paper is
more damaging than a fake one, because the referee may be its author.

### Step 4 — Status

Check that the paper has not been retracted or corrected, and whether a
cited working paper has since been published (then cite the journal
version). For replication-contested results, cite the dispute or choose a
different benchmark.

### Step 5 — Ledger

Maintain a verification ledger alongside `references.bib`:

```text
KEY                  DOI-OK  FIELDS-OK  CLAIM-OK  VERSION      CHECKED
goodman_bacon_2021   yes     yes        yes       published    2026-06-12
hjort_poulsen_2019   yes     yes        yes       published    2026-06-12
```

Any row that cannot reach all-yes is removed from the manuscript or
explicitly flagged to the user as unverified. **Never silently keep an
unverified citation.**

## BibTeX Hygiene

- One key convention, applied everywhere: `author_author_year` lowercase
  (matching `references.bib` in this repository).
- Every entry carries a DOI, or an explicit no-DOI note with a stable URL.
- No duplicate entries under variant keys; no fields invented to fill gaps.
- In-text citations compile against the bibliography with zero unresolved
  keys — `aer-consistency` runs this check as part of the full-manuscript
  audit.

## Common Failure Modes

- A bibliography assembled from model memory and "cleaned up" afterward —
  verification is the assembly step, not a post-process
- The novelty scan run only on Google Scholar, missing the NBER working
  paper that scoops the contribution
- "X et al. (2020) show that..." where the paper *suggests* it in the
  discussion section
- Antecedents described from their abstracts, then misrepresented in the
  introduction's value-added contrast
- Citing five surveys to establish a fact one primary source established

## Repository Resources

Bundled with the installed skill, no repository checkout needed --- read it
before the repo resources below:

- `references/citation-verification-protocol.md` --- fetch-before-cite protocol, claim-audit table, BibTeX hygiene

When working from the AER-skills repository or plugin bundle, load only the
relevant resource:

- Verified estimator and diagnostic citations with BibTeX keys:
  `docs/methods-reference.md` and `references.bib`
- Recent papers by subfield for positioning benchmarks:
  `examples/modern-aer-exemplars.md`
- Classic contribution archetypes: `examples/aer-exemplars.md`
- The novelty-audit questions this skill's search must answer:
  `skills/aer-topic-selection/SKILL.md`

## Handoff

```text
CLOSEST PAPERS MAPPED: <n> (target 3-6)
SCOOP RISK: <none found / named paper + implication>
POSITIONING MOVE: <new question | identification | data | mechanism | correction | unification>
REFERENCES VERIFIED: <n>/<total> (existence / fields / claim / version)
UNVERIFIED ENTRIES: <list, or "none — all verified">
NEXT SKILL: <aer-introduction | aer-topic-selection | aer-consistency>
```

## Anti-Patterns

- Writing the antecedents paragraph before building the antecedents map
- Treating citation verification as a formatting task to do "at the end"
- Keeping a citation because it "is probably real" — probability is not the
  standard; a fetched record is
- Softening "what it does not do" into vagueness, leaving the value-added
  claim uncontrasted
- Citing the referee-bait paper without reading it — referees test exactly
  those sentences
