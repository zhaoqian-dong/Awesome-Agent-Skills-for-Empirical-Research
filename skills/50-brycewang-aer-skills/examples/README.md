| [`honest-did-demo/`](honest-did-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why a flat-looking pre-trend can break naive parallel-trends coverage and honest DiD relative-magnitudes bounds restore it |
| [`dml-plr-demo/`](dml-plr-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why flexible ML prediction alone is not causal inference — a non-orthogonal plug-in stays attenuated at a knowable factor while DML partialling-out with cross-fitting recovers the truth with honest coverage |
| [`randomization-inference-demo/`](randomization-inference-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why robust-SE t-tests over-reject in small experiments with concentrated leverage and the Fisher randomization test has exact size while retaining power |

| [`lp-did-demo/`](lp-did-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why pooled TWFE event studies are contaminated under staggered adoption with heterogeneous dynamics and LP-DiD with clean controls recovers the true dynamic path |
| [`bunching-demo/`](bunching-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing how excess mass at a tax kink identifies the earnings elasticity (Saez), with oracle-vs-feasible counterfactuals and two falsification worlds |
| [`matrix-completion-demo/`](matrix-completion-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why DiD is structurally biased under interactive fixed effects and low-rank matrix-completion imputation recovers the truth — including the rank-sensitivity caveat |
| [`sun-abraham-demo/`](sun-abraham-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why the naive dynamic TWFE event study is a contaminated cross-cohort mixture under heterogeneous dynamics and the Sun-Abraham interaction-weighted estimator recovers the true dynamic path |

| [`sensitivity-rv-demo/`](sensitivity-rv-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why coefficient stability does not bound omitted-variable bias and the Cinelli-Hazlett robustness value reports the partial R-squared a confounder needs to overturn the result |
| [`power-mde-demo/`](power-mde-demo/) | Runnable Python simulation showing why the analytic minimum detectable effect is exactly the target-power effect and an underpowered design exaggerates the estimates it manages to detect (Type-M) |

## How to Use

These examples are **reference architectures**, not paste-able content.
The fictional broadband paper used in `intro-example.md` and
`rebuttal-example.md` is consistent across both files so you can see how
the same project moves from initial draft to R&R revision.

To start your own project:

1. **Pick 2-3 papers from `aer-exemplars.md`** that match your design
2. **Read them as architecture templates** (reverse-outline in 30 minutes)
3. **Scaffold `replication-package-skeleton/`** into your project
4. **Use `intro-example.md` and `rebuttal-example.md`** as reference for
   the writing skills (`aer-introduction`, `aer-rebuttal`)

```bash
python3 scripts/scaffold_project.py skeleton /path/to/new-replication-package
```

Add `--dry-run` first if you want to inspect the planned copies.

For runnable demos, install the pinned Python stack in
[`../templates/python/requirements.txt`](../templates/python/requirements.txt)
and run the optional smoke gate from the repository root:

```bash
make smoke-examples
```

The smoke gate executes demo assertions when dependencies are present and skips
missing optional stacks by default. Use
`python3 scripts/run_example_smoke.py --strict-deps` before release to fail on
any missing dependency or failed demo assertion.

**Numeric-check contract.** Each runnable demo is also a regression test: it pins
every headline estimate to a *known* target — a Monte Carlo truth, a coverage
rate, or a published number — and fails if the estimate drifts outside a stated
tolerance. Demos express this through the shared helper
[`_aer_numeric_check.py`](_aer_numeric_check.py) (Python) or an inline equivalent
(R), which emits one machine-checkable `NUMERIC-CHECK | name | got | spec | PASS`
line per assertion. The smoke gate fails a demo that runs but emits no such line
(so the assertions cannot silently rot into a no-op that still exits 0), and
`scripts/validate_repo.py` statically requires every demo to use the protocol.
This is the econometric analogue of an L1-tolerance replication gate: "the demo
ran" is not enough; the answer must be numerically correct.

Before copying an example's structure into a manuscript, cross-check the design
against [`../docs/methods-reference.md`](../docs/methods-reference.md) and run
the [`../docs/desk-rejection-audit.md`](../docs/desk-rejection-audit.md). The
examples show architecture; the audit and methods reference decide whether that
architecture is defensible for your paper.
